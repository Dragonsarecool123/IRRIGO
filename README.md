# IRRIGO
IOT based remote watering and monitoring system
Improper watering is one of the main reasons why household plants die. Most people do not have any concrete methods of watering their plants when they are away. Our project ‘Irrigo’, short for ‘Irrigation on the Go’, aims to resolve this problem. 
Irrigo is an IOT based smart gardening system. It allows people to remotely water and monitor the environmental factors (moisture, humidity, temperature) of their plants. This leads to convenience and an increase in the plant’s lifespan. 
The project consists of 2 parts; the ‘on-site’ model and the app. Our model was made using the ESP32 microcontroller which has been coded using the Arduino IDE. Our app was made using the Blynk software. 
Our app graphically presents the humidity and temperature of the plants. It has watering buttons that allow a user to water their plants. Our most recent prototype also offers a live feed. 
Our code has been written by referring to a large database of plant growth values. Using these, we defined upper and lower bounds for different plants. Hence, our model can water and monitor all kinds of plants according to their individual water needs which is preferable for house plants. 
Our project was supplemented with primary and secondary research to understand the needs and problems of the market.
